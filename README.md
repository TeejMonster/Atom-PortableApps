Atom Wrapper for Portable Apps
===================


Atom can run as a portable app, but getting it to show up in the PortableApps menu is a little annoying.  This launcher allows Atom to be dropped in unaltered and show up as a Portable App on the [PortableApps.com](http://portableapps.com/) menu.  All the exe does is look for __Atom/atom.exe__ and launches that, passing through any arguments.
